# Intro to HTTP Servers in Golang

## Project Summary

This project was written alongside the course "Learn HTTP Servers in Go" by boot.dev with project direction given by the course and testing suites provided for each lesson. It is written with the net/http standard library.

The project is a simplified mock of a 'twitter'-eque platform called 'Chirpy' where users are registered and they can post 'chirps'. Currently implemented: user account creation, chirp creation, login with hashed passwords, authentication on posting with JWT and refresh tokens, and authorization (with a fictional premium project 'chirpy red').

Additional tools used: [SQLC](https://sqlc.dev/) for autogeneration of typed interfaces and dababase methods; [Goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) as a database migration tool.

The main purpose of this project was to build a web server with additional database functionality, it does include a 'front-end' which is a static page found at localhost:8080 as well as a webpage found at the endpoint /api/metrics which returns the number of times the page has been visited.

## Local Set-up
1. Copy repo

` git clone <repo> <directory> `

2. Get dependencies

You can download the listed dependencies using:

` go mod download `

However, this won't install all necessary dependencies for this project. In particular, the database management tool 'goose' is needed which can be installed with:

`go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest`

3. Local Database Set-up

This project was developed for use with postgres (version 15). Once installed locally create a database called 'chirpy'.

You can check if you have psql (the defauly cli for postgres) by typing `psql --version` in your terminal. Once installed start a postgres server in the background, enter the psql shell and create a new database using: `CREATE DATABASE chirpy;`

You can check that it has correctly started by entering the database and querying: `SELECT version();`

4. Environment variables

Create a file named: '.env' add to it the following environment variables that are imported and used through the code:

```
DB_URL = postgres://<username>:@localhost:<port>/chirpy?sslmode=disable
PLATFORM = "dev"
SECRET = <Any random string>
POLKA_KEY = "f271c81ff7084ee5b99a5091b42d486e"
```

A random string can easily be generated in terminal using the following command:
`openssl rand -base64 <n>`
where `<n>` is the length of the random string desired e.g, `openssl rand -base64 64`

The Polka Key is the api key of a fictional third party service, to test the authorization is correctly implemented this can be set to any key as long as the authorization header in the corresponding request matches.

PLATFORM allows for access to the /api/reset endpoint, which allowed for boot.dev's testing suite to have a clean database for each submission.

### Detailed Descriptions by Endpoint

All requests must contain the relevant authorizations â€“ in particular the relevant JWT (which contains necessary user ID data amongst other properties).

#### 1. /api/chirps - GET & POST
##### GET
This endpoint returns chirps from the database. By default it returns them all ordered by the date created in ascending order (oldest first).

- Queries
This endpoint accepts two URL query parameters:
1. `?author_id=<author id>` where the author ID is the UUID of a specific user that created the chirp.
2. `?sort=<order>` if 'order' is 'desc' then it will return either all or the author's chirps in descending order (newest first). Anything other than 'desc' will return chirps in default order.

- Response Structure

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "body": "<chirp 1>",
    "author_id": <user id of the chirp poster>,
    "created_at": "<created time of chirp 1>",
    "updated_at": "<updated time of chirp 1>"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "body": "<chirp 2>",
    "author_id": <user id of the chirp poster>,
    "created_at": "<created time of chirp 2>",
    "updated_at": "<updated time of chirp 2>"
  }
]
```

##### POST
This endpoint is used to create a new 'chirp'.

- Request Structure

```
{
    "body":"<chirp content>"
}
```

- Response Structure

```
  {
    "id": <chirp id>,
    "body": "<chirp content>",
    "author_id": <user id of the chirp poster>,
    "created_at": "<created time of chirp>",
    "updated_at": "<updated time of chirp>"
  }
```
